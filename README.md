# Overview

OddsCheck is a web app that I developed to help teachers maximize 
the funding success of their projects on [DonorsChoose.org](donorschoose.org).
You can try out the web app at [oddscheck.me](oddscheck.me).
I developed the project in a two week period during a fellowship at
[Insight Data Science](http://insightdatascience.com/).
I received loads of advice and feedback from mentors and other fellows 
along the way; thank you all for your help!
The project is essentially a set of Jupyter notebooks with exploratory
data analysis of the DonorsChoose dataset, a set of python and R scripts
for training and testing models, and a web application written in Flask.
